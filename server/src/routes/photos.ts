/**
 * routes/photos.ts
 *
 * Photos are stored as files in $HOME/.lumora/photos/<id>.<ext> and served
 * as static files at GET /photos/:id.  The DB stores only the filename and
 * a relative URL.
 *
 * POST /photos          — multipart upload (field name: "file") + optional caption
 * GET  /photos          — list all photo metadata for the household
 * DELETE /photos/:id    — delete photo file + DB row
 *
 * Static serving of the actual image files is handled in index.ts via
 * express.static pointed at PHOTOS_DIR.
